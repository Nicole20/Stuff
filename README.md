# Stuff

This game consists of three different physics concepts: a rope, a seesaw, and a spring. You control a ball that can roll and jump around. I put the ball from the Rolling Ball project to interact with the different objects.
For a step-by-step process on the physics and Main Menu, follow the Brackeys: “Make a Game” tutorial videos 14 to 16.

# Unity Objects

- One Sphere (Ball)
- One Directional Light
- One Camera
- One Cube (Base of seesaw)
- Any number of Cylinders (Rope and Spring)

# Unity Components

Add the BallControl.js and BallFall.js to the sphere object.
Add the MainMenu.js to the Camera.
Add three UI buttons in the Main Menu scene, and one UI button in the other three scenes.
Add any textures and any skybox you'd like.
